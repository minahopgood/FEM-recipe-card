## My process

### Acomplishments
I'm proud of my labeling during this challenge. I took a holiday halfway through creating this project, and came back to it quite easily because of the classes and id's used. It gave me a bit of a boost knowing that I am on the right track!

### Resources
- Semantic HTML: [Semrush}(https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/) I used this website to help me understand semantic HTML a bit better, and to see which tags I should use for which sections of my website.
- Tag list: [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) This list of semantic HTML tags by W3 Schools really helped me see the full extent of what you can do with semantic markup.
